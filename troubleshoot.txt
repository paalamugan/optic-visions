Install mysql in linux

https://medium.com/@alef.duarte/cant-connect-to-local-mysql-server-through-socket-var-run-mysqld-mysqld-sock-155d580f3a06

Error

1. Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)

Solution:
    Must check whether mysql server runnig or not.(Becoz this error shows only mysql server doesn't running).
    sudo service mysql start

2. su: warning: cannot change directory to /nonexistent: No such file or directory

    Solution:
        sudo service mysql stop
        sudo usermod -d /var/lib/mysql/ mysql
        sudo service mysql start

3. Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client

Solution: 
    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
    flush privileges;


    If that doesn't work, try it without @'localhost' part.



Install postgres in linux

1. Install 
    sudo apt install postgresql

2. Create new user
    sudo -u postgres psql
    postgres=# create database mydb;
    postgres=# create user myuser with encrypted password 'mypass';
    postgres=# grant all privileges on database mydb to myuser;


3. Drop USER
    sudo -u postgres psql
    drop user myuser;

    if you get error like -
    role "myuser" cannot be dropped because some objects depend on it
    DETAIL:  privileges for database mydb;

    and then try this,
        alter user myuser nologin;
        or
        REASSIGN owned by myuser to otheruser;

4. Drop all tables

    drop schema public cascade;
    create schema public;
    grant  all on SCHEMA public to postgres;
    grant all on SCHEMA public  to PUBLIC;
